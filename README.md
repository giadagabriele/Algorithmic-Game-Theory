↳ The system must select the user who will perform the tour, must define the places that the tour will visit and must define the payments charged to the users. The only constraint we have is the maximum payout. Costs proportional to kilometers should be equally distributed and fixed costs should be based on declared utilities, so we must implement mechanisms that lead to truthful declarations of utilities.
